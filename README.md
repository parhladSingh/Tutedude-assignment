# 🎥 Tutedude — Proctoring System (SDE Assignment)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **video proctoring system** built for online interviews/exams.  
It ensures integrity by detecting:
- Whether the candidate is focused on the screen.
- Unauthorized items (phone, books, notes, extra devices).
- Suspicious activities like multiple faces or absence.

The system works in real-time on the browser using **React + TensorFlow.js**.
